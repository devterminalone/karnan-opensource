### Information

[Karan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnan_(2021_film)) is a movie directed by acclaimed director [Mari Selvaraj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari_Selvaraj). Before the release of this film, they release three songs including a song titled Pandarathi Puranam.

Some groups took offence to the word Pandarathi and filed a case. Mari Selvaraj eventually agreed to change the name from Pandarathi to Manjanathi and published the new version of the song.
